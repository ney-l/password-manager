# About

A basic offline password manager starter project implemented in Python.

## Disclaimer ⚠️
This is just a starter project. Please do not use this to actually store your passwords. 🙅‍♀️ As passwords should be stored following **OWASP Password Storage recommendations** and this project does not incorporate those guidelines. Say in future if I was choose to upgrade this to incorporate hashing and encryption, I cannot say that I will also make the code available on a public repository for any hacker to look for vulnerabilities. 🤔
