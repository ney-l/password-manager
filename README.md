# About

A basic offline password manager starter project implemented in Python.

## Features:
- Fields you can save Website, Email/Username, Password
- Let's you generate a random password
- Email/Username is prefilled with your most email/username. This value is hardcoded in the code. 
- The app validates your entries to make sure no field was left empty.
- You are asked to confirm the credentials before the data is saved.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is just a starter project. Please do not use this to actually store your passwords. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As passwords should be stored following **OWASP Password Storage recommendations** and this project does not incorporate those guidelines. Say in future if I was choose to upgrade this to incorporate hashing and encryption, I cannot say that I will also make the code available on a public repository for any hacker to look for vulnerabilities. ü§î
